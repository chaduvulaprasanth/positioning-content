							The above code might be a little bit confusing but of course, we will go through the above code in detail. Actually, the clearfix method consists of after and before pseudo elements.
							<br>
							After and before pseudo elements creates dynamic content above and below the class wherever we apply. Here, in this case, the content is empty but if we put anything inside the content(content: "pseudo") we can see the dynamic content will appear on our page. If it feels confusing don't worry just write the code we will cover this topic again in our complex selector chapter.

							<p>In the above code, the before and after pseudo element will create a hidden element above and below the clearfix class which we have applied to our parent. We displayed the pseudo elements as a table, just to make it block level element so that it should take full available width above and below the element. We displayed it to a table just to ensure consistency for the older version of internet explorer or else display block will also work fine.</p>
